# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is designed to ensure that all elements are displayed correctly across popular screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience on various devices. Using Figma wireframes as the primary blueprint, I meticulously translated the design into a responsive and interactive website.

Functionality:

- Responsive Design: The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring that content is displayed correctly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- Interactive Buttons: Hover effects are implemented on buttons, providing visual feedback to users and enhancing the interactive experience.

- Image Liking Feature: Users can like images by clicking on them, adding an element of engagement and personalization to the site.

**Development Process:**

- To build this project, I utilized Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my primary development environment. VS Code provided an efficient and customizable workspace where I could write, test, and debug my code. The integrated terminal allowed me to manage dependencies and run development servers seamlessly.

- For version control and collaboration, I used GitHub. I initialized a Git repository within VS Code to track changes in my codebase. This allowed me to commit and push updates to a remote repository on GitHub regularly, ensuring that my work was backed up and easily accessible. GitHub also facilitated version control, enabling me to manage different branches of development and collaborate with others if needed.

- This combination of VS Code and GitHub streamlined the development process, ensuring that the project was well-organized, easily managed, and efficiently developed.
